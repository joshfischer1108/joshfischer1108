# 👋 Hey, I’m Josh Fischer

I build **secure systems that move money and data safely**, and I believe the future of the internet depends on it.

---

### 🛠️ What I’m working on
- **[BirdyFoot Systems](https://birdyfoot.com/)** – consulting and building secure infrastructure for high-velocity teams  
- **[TwigBush](https://github.com/TwigBush)** – open-source [GNAP (Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9635) engine built in Go  
  → A new foundation for **agentic commerce**, **delegated trust**, and **secure AI transactions**

---

### 💡 What I care about
- Designing **authorization protocols** for the AI era (key-bound, auditable, dynamic)
- Making **secure payment flows** programmable  
- Bridging open-source and real-world production systems  
- Helping teams go from *chaotic* → *secure, observable, fast*

---

### 🚀 Quick facts
- Ex-**Mastercard, Amazon, Twitter** consultant
- Now designing the **secure dynamic infra layer** under AI agents and fintech platforms
